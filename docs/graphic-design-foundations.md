[The golden section, a universal and successful proportion](https://www.lynda.com/Design-Techniques-tutorials/golden-section-universal-successful-proportion/135095/153702-4.html?orientation=1)

# 3. Proportions

## **A. Symmetry**

## **B. Asymmetry**

## **C. Building ratios based on squares**

## **D. The golden section**

- Method for organizing elements, including typography, images and shapes
- The exact mathematics aren't always needed - this is more a useful guide
- Look for the section - where can you see it?

## **E. Using the golden section**

- You can use the in your designs as a layer - draw the shape in illustrator and then overlay in PS
- This won't always be precise, especially in different sized works
- The golden section is a great guide for creating harmony and cohesion between elements

## **F. The rule of thirds**

- Most layouts include the rule of thirds in some way. This lets us effectively create tension and questions
- Layouts like the rule of thirds help us to create tension, holding our users attention
- As always, the rule of thirds is a guide. You can always adjust as needed

# 4. Grids

## A. The anatomy of grids

- Grids act as a guide for out layout, using multiple components:
  - Margins (edges)
  - Columns (columns of content)
  - Gutters (separations between each column)
  - Hang-lines (horizontal guides to align content)
  - Headers, markers (footers) & page numbers

## B. Grid Variations

- Column and grid flexibility should change based on the content (e.g. academic journal vs magazine)
- One factor in your grid is the amount of copy you want to show (rule of thumbs suggest you should have approx. 52
- Website grids should be approached differently. Squares fit the format more than rectangles

## C. Choosing the right grid

- What is the content?
  - One type?
  - Complicated? (like graphs or numbers?)
  - Who is the user?
  - Where will the content be seen/designed
- We all have expectations about layouts and grid structures:
  - Books or academic publications - 2 columns
  - Magazines - multiple columns and images
  - Websites - navigation bar at the top
- Good design often means challenging and pushing against these expectations

## D. Creating the grid

- Determine the size and where the design will be presented
- Sketch some ideas or variations (in paper or computer) based on the size of the project
- Use Photoshop and InDesigns guides feature to lay the grid out, and if it looks wrong, start again

## E. How to use the grid

- Start by putting all of your content onto the page in a basic structure
- After the first design, create 20 different variations. This lets you compare each page side by side, rather than continually moving elements on one single page
- Create big and outrageous variations, pushing the boundaries of the grid

# 5. Attributes

## A. The power of simplicity and minimalism

- It's easy to default to adding more and more elements, hoping to make the design work
- Clutter and adding more colors and elements will rarely improve the design. Simplicity has strength
- The Bauhaus design school (from Germany) pioneered minimalistic design, inspiring the industry

## B. Using excess to success

- There are times when excess can be effective. Like with everything in design, breaking the rules (guides) around minimalism can be strong in some circumstances
- This decision often rests on the message being conveyed. The poster for a cafe should have minimal information. A website, brochure or phone number can provide additional context and information as needed
- Hierarchy and consistency is essential to enable the successful use of excess elements

## C. Creating consistency (without too much)

- Consistency in design helps users consume information, helps guide flows, and helps ensure cohesiveness and cohesion amongst elements
- People look for patterns - meaning, symbols and repetition. Design should cater to and acknowledge this preference
- Consistency becomes essential when we are working with complex and dense content (e.g. websites)
- Consistency is important for brands (Nike, Apple, Google). However, we need to draw the line between consistency and holding interest - change is important and enticing

## D. Using surprise to create drama

- The surprise of a bright color used for a serious topic, or vice versa, creates surprise and interest. This type of drama can effectively show the tone being conveyed
- Surprise can also be achieved with removing expected elements, or changing the scale of the content used

## E. Creating rhythm in multiple page layouts

- Due to the quantity of content we all see, repetition quickly becomes boring and loses our attention quickly. This can be offset with introducing variation into our rhythms. We can repeat our color palette while introducing new elements in each page of a magazine
- Each page should be designed in conjunction with each other page. The layouts should be similar or related, continuing themes and elements

# 6. Images and words

## A. Cropping images successfully

- When cropping people, crop them mid-limb (rather than at the waste, elbow, or knee). This creates a sense of continuity
- Focus on the subject. Is there any elements that take away attention? Are there elements we can crop out to focus the framing?
- Cropping images lets us focus on telling the story, highlighting the key feature we are calling attention onto

## B. Making words and images work together

- When used correctly, words add meaning to images. They add, enhance or change meaning
- When used incorrectly, words will describe the seen, adding nothing
- As always, each choice creates meaning. We need to consider the impact each choice is having

## C. Beware of hidden meanings

- We should always be aware of the risk of hidden meanings, intended or unintended. This is most often a risk when we haven't even considered the outcomes

## D. Using images as guides

- Within a layout, images have meaning. This should be considered in conjunction with the other components. These images inform the overall layout

## E. Sequence and storytelling in design

- Best-in-class examples of sequencing and storytelling - comic books. They effectively demonstrate the different ways of moving through stories

# Conclusion

- Breaking the rules is allowed, great and encouraged
- Our goal is to communicate our message in a dynamic way
