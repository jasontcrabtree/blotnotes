Monzo

Since October - first user research lead

Half the room had heard about user research

Good design solves meaningful problems - which is hard for us. People have bias and natural characteristics that push against us being able to understand other people’s perspectives.

Learning to empathise is a skill - we can’t all empathise and we can’t all empathise to the same extent.

Learning this is a skill.

We can break this down using an example. Imagine we’re designing a bike. You might start by choosing a size based on your morning commute. Then you choose a colour. This doesn’t work.

The things we choose for ourselves differ from what other people will choose. There are a dozen different uses for a bike, a seemingly simple product.

Designing for one person cuts everyone else out. Designing for everyone’s needs doesn’t work either. We can’t include fifty accessories on a each bike.

User research helps us work through this. Instead of asking what everyone needs, we ask about our users goals, needs and contexts.

Bike example (card from Thailand). Do they need a bike? Or are they really using the bike to achieve the goals of a cart?

Evaluative or explorative.

Early in user research starts as explorative. This starts with us looking at peoples behaviours. While attitudes change daily, hourly, behaviours remain consistent.

Later in the product lifecycle, we start to focus on evaluative research. This leads to iteration.

Bringing this back to Monzo, the current team is lean, with everyone wearing different hats.

User testing was one of these hats - often done by product managers or other employees from different areas.

This initial testing was leading to some friction.

Too many people, focus groups.

No repeatable processes - and no consistent way to capture the information.

This has been a key focus of change.

Photo example of a test - two rooms, one with the person doing the test, the other with the stakeholders of that specific test. This format lets the stakeholders discuss and come to agreement straight away. A key focus for this is the assumptions being testing. This is explicitly highlighted with a flip chart - listing out each of the assumptions the design tests.

This is in lab testing. We can also do guerilla, or street, testing. This involves talking to people as hoc in the street.

User testing is a big commitment. Because of this - it can be hard to get the resources needed. This is something to overcome - a single test might take all day for the key stakeholders involved. Demonstrating that value can be hard when you first start. This can lead to street testing being more important

Contrasting that - you do need to focus on testing with the right groups. E.g testing with people who use overdrafts vs don’t.

Another test we can use is a diary study. This can be done across the product spectrum - whether you have a product, an idea, or nothing specific at all. Asking participants to keep diary’s about specific ideas, themes or behaviours can quickly help develop insights, letting you focus in on your areas of opportunity. This can be even more valuably down the line when you start to conduct in-depth user research interviews. The diary’s can be used to help us ensure we’re speaking with a wide range of people, rather than focusing on people like us who act similarly.

Example of taxi driver or chefs and cooks. (Limo driver, chefs and home cooks).

Learning from people who aren’t like you is super powerful.

Currently doing a diary study at Monzo. Rather than focusing on broad exploratory themes - this focuses on a new and specific product. This is helping us to understand and iterate on something we know we need to improve. Over the three week diary cycle, we’ll be asking for information and entries about context and situations every day. While this isn’t a conclusive dataset (15 participants), it’s rich data. This is perfect for a new feature like the spending tab.

User research for me - is about reducing uncertainty. Whenever we design new products or features - we’re never sure. Everything changes, and we can’t predict this. Imagine asking someone about the future of CDs 15 years ago - predicting their rapid demise wouldn’t have been likely.

In user research we use a mix of data, each for different needs. Broadly, she defines this as:

Data = what
Quant = who
Qual = why

A few tips:

Bad research is worse than no research

- [ ] can send you in the wrong direction (biased research)
- [ ] Undermines good research
- [ ] Asking questions in the right way is a difficult skill - and not doing so can be actively harmful
- [ ] Lab testing - people have a lot of behavioural traits about that situation, bad questions makes this more pronounced and worse
- [ ] - Build and beta test
- [ ] - prototype

Be aware of your assumptions

- [ ] ask for help
- [ ] Start with questions, not answers

Be aware of your biases

- [ ] we all have biases (even if we aren’t aware of them!)
- [ ] We all have mental models and cognitive tricks and shortcuts to cope. If we aren’t aware of this when we’re research, our research becomes derailed and flawed by it.

Questions:

- [ ] Budgets - managing sample sizes. Depends on what we’re asking

Picking candidates for diary studies

- [ ] balanced gender, ages and backgrounds
- [ ] Attitudinal questions about overdrafts and spending
- [ ] Some customers, some that just top up
- [ ] These all focus on ensuring we’re making it suitable for as many people as we can - we don’t want to exclude customers through our testing
- [ ] Diary’s help compared to user tests to see behaviour over time (over a month)
- [ ] Currently (for Monzo) - only customers

Diary testing - quality control and consistency

- [ ] how do you pick people who will fill in the diary and be consistent and fill in the detail
- [ ] Surveys and initial testing panel (start with 1000,200,50,15)
- [ ] Final people - told what it will entail
- [ ] X3 encentivise methods - initial test submissio, regular check ins during the month, final debrief session. Financial incentives

At Monzo - what challenges compared to other places?

- [ ] some things due to size, e.g implementing user research has been smooth because used to be no ones job - so quite quick pick up with specific direction
- [ ] Future and forward thinking is becoming more difficult (compared to user testing) which was being done before

How did you get people involved who wouldn’t be in day to day

- [ ] one on ones
- [ ] Focused in connecting with stakeholders and understanding their priorities
- [ ] Vocal with the team about getting them to testers - and why being there is valuable
- [ ] Focus on specific assumptions designers etc may have - so can specifically see the benefit
- [ ] Live streams - and shared at wed team meeting. Focus on company wide education

Whats an example where someone wanted a survey and that was the wrong tool

- [ ] Product market - wanted a survey to understand people’s savings accounts (for marketplaces)
- [ ] Better solution to build a lean solution and test from there - but in this instance did end up building a survey.
- [ ] Data came back and wasn’t meaningful - after which PM realised survey was incorrect too

Strong community - is that where they get testers?

- [ ] early adopters and strong supporters - so sometimes, but not great for representative and unbiased opinions

User research for recent release of debit cards instead of prepaid cards

- [ ] actually not much testing because this was an existential step in process of becoming a bank, so not actually something to test

For testing a long flow, should you test separately or each component individually

- [ ] depends on the circumstances
- [ ] Is the test based on the flow, or specific features
- [ ] A lot of this depends on the context - but generally start with high level then each time drill down

What methods are most effective for early problem space research

- [ ] Speak to people - are you hearing the same thing?
- [ ] Then once you are - look at the smallest thing you can build to test that problem and your concept within that problem

How important is it for Monzo to test with a range of technical (tech) ability

- [ ] Because it’s app only - most people do have a certain level of tech ability
- [ ] Current criteria - either Monzo customers, or banking app customers (with other banks) and this naturally narrows the participants

Through different customer journeys we have different expectations, how do we manage consistency across these journeys (e.g savings, chequer account)

- [ ] design patterns
- [ ] Copy
- [ ] Keeping it simple has worked for Monzo

Incentivizing customer testing - how to get people to commit and the right people through the door

- [ ] £40-60 per hour, if more specialised will need to offer more (£40 at Monzo)
- [ ] Always plan on some drop-outs and have one spare and mostly fine
- [ ] Uses a recruiter who follows up before hand
- [ ] Cash is best
