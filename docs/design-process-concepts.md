## 25 Minute Design School

> Though the knowledge and skills needed to make it as a Product Designer are important, they’re not nearly as important as the innate qualities one must have which lay the foundation for everything else. If you’re empathetic by nature, and you have a head for problem solving, along with a thorough understanding of general design principles and processes, a healthy combination of functional and aesthetic sensibilities, a willingness to learn, and you enjoy the work, there’s absolutely no reason you can’t quit your shit job as soon as possible, so that you might do what you were really born to do. :)

## Strategy

Product design is about attribution - trading off and prioritizing decisions and features over time. What adds value for the user, while being affordable and realistic given the constraints?

Where do you begin and how do you know when you have prioritized the right thing?

Frameworks have been developed to help make these decisions (e.g. Lean UX, Design Thinking, BJ Fogg's Behavior Model).

**Lean UX**:

Rapid experimentation and continous iteration of minimum viable solutions. Tests risky assumptions and encourages prototypes.

**Design Thinking**:

Discover, Interpret, Ideate, Experiment and Evolve

Design thinking emphasizes collabarotion and including a wide variety of stakeholders (e.g. customers, engineers, marketing team, customer support, designers, management).

**Fogg Behavior Model:**

The Fogg behaviour model assesses ease of use and motivation for different types of user behavior. How likely is the user to do this? How easy is this to do?

## Gathering Requirements

Every design process starts with understanding the problem space and requirements of what you are doing.

Some questions we might ask:

- What's the problem?
- Who has the problem?
- How can the problem be simplified to its most basic element?
- Whats been done already?
- What needs to be redone or improved?
- What are the most pressing concerns?
- What are the constraints?

For all of these - we need to ask WHY, WHY, WHY.

Asking these questions helps us to understand the problem. These questions are also rife with assumptions. We need to understand and address these assumptions throughout the design process.
