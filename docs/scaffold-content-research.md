## Researching Content, Writing, Sales and Marketing Strategy for Scaffold

## SURVIVE PANIC BUSINESS

[https://stackingthebricks.com/survive-panic-business/][1]

**Launched a product with no sales?**
Step back and analyse what was missing.
Did you have people ready to buy? Did you create something they wanted? Why would they buy now?

**Survival isn’t a Single Step. It’s one small decision after another.**

1. Identify the threat and be honest about what you’re actually worried about.
2. Maintain your reference points — who you are, where you are, what resources you have.
3. Figure out one small step to get closer to resolution.

## 30x500 TASTE TEST

[https://stackingthebricks.com/the-3-part-30x500-taste-test/][2]

### 1. How can you come up with a workable product idea

  Thomas Edison applied failure-driven process; “When I want to discover something, I begin by reading up everything that has been done along that line in the past — that’s what all these books are for. I see what has been accomplished at great labor and expense in the past. I gather data of many thousands of experiments as a starting point, and then I make thousands more.”

**Via a story about Edison we learn you need to focus, via observation on:**

- Customers Pain
- Customers Dream
- Research and interrogate the causes and parts of the problem
- Brainstorm the method and format of the fix
- Customers Fix

### 30 x 500 Amy Hoy Sales Safari Process

1. Isolate and focus narrowly on one specific pain and dream
2. Interrogate via research: what kind/type of pain, what are the causes, what are the parts, what are the mistakes, knowledge, skills, beliefs and tools involved
3. Fixstorm™️ combine systematically the types of fixes (education, equipment, product) and formats (written, video, software, service)

Then do it again for another pain and dream.

**Examples:**

1. What hurts?
2. What do they buy?
3. What do they want?

**Sales Safari Formula:**
Pain + Dream = Fix

**Then ask yourself for each method:**
How can I apply the fixstorm approach to help solve these problems via:

1. Educate
2. Equip
3. Support
4. Access
5. Outsource
6. Eliminate

### Different Methods of Solving Problems (as indie biz)

- Written: Book, blog, lessons, whitepaper, cheat sheets
- Video: Screencasts, workshops, subscriptions
- Classes: Live workshops, bootcamps, webinars, conference
- Templates: Code, visuals, snippets, resources, docs
- Consulting: Individual, group, ongoing, one-off, structured
- Membership: Community, form, list, space, equipment
- Software: Feature, downloadable, apps, SaaS
- Components: Plugins, workflows, macros, recipes

**6 Major Methods:**

- Educate: Teach them how to do it themselves
- Equip: Outfit them with the tools, supplies and components they need
- Support: Help them overcome fear, anxiety, avoidance, etc with philosophy or community
- Access: Connect them to people/stuff/places they could not reach or afford
- Outsource: Automate, do it for them
- Eliminate: Change, bypass, or eliminate the task entirely

### 2. How can you create (free) marketing content that will drive list growth and sales

- Ebomb = educational content marketing
- Ebombs answer questions and provide compelling reasons for those answers (prove you understand the problem)
- Provide QUESTION, ANSWER, and PROOF

#### The simplest E-bomb recipe

1. Question (quite specific), proof detail x3,
2. Answer (just … one, and answer specifically!
3. CTA (don’t miss my next post)

**How to do this without an internet following:**
Build trust over time, no-one starts famous. Build slow and steady via ebombs.

### 3. What’s wrong with lean startup and sales driven customer development

Amy’s answer: *They focus on the wrong question.*

**Lean startup:** How do I ship and test faster

**Sales development:** How do I find people who want to buy the product?

Amy’s question: *“How do I make a product I know will sell?”*

**Three Organising Questions 30x500 is based on:**

1. Who am I serving?
2. What do they already need, want and buy?
3. How can I reach and persuade them?

Answers these questions via research!
30x500 focuses on:
Audience \>\> Needs, Wants, and Buy

Audience: Who am I serving? **This is not a big deal. Repeat: NOT a big deal.**

### What do they need, want and buy

This hangs off the first question! It’s important to be specific with your audience. Don’t be vague.
This question is actually about the overlapping Venn diagram of Need+Want+Buy, and the specific thing in the middle.

### How do you research? Amy’s suggestion

1. Find out where UX Designers hang out online
2. Lurk with a purpose
3. Write down pain points, beliefs, world-views, complaints, questions, struggles, products, desires
4. Do this a lot … 30, 40, 50 hours BEFORE you set out to try and create a product.

Success is all about the work before the product development, the research, analysis, gathering and pre-work discovery.

Research gives you confidence that even though you feel fear, you have data that says people need and want this, and proof to do it anyway — even if you feel fear.

People \>\> need, want, buy \>\>\>\> product.

#### Question 3

How can I reach and persuade them to read, share and buy?
Via research you can establish: How to reach (watering holes, sharing), how to persuade (needs, jargon, desires, beliefs)

### Time tested advice

#### Seek REAL DATA and answer three questions

1. Who am I serving?
2. What do they already need, want and buy?
3. How can I reach and persuade them?
4. And how do I do all that systematically and repeatably?

### 3 Rules to Make Writing for your Audience Easier

1. DON’T FORCE A LESSON. GREAT EBOMBS ANSWER REAL QUESTIONS FROM REAL PEOPLE.
1. Don’t force a lesson! Great Ebombs answer real questions from real people
2. If one person asks a question, chances are good they’re not the only one
3. Write like you’re responding to an individual person

### Homework

Find ==**one question from your audience “in the wild” and answer it on your blog**==
Following the guide above, you can ship the most basic kind of Ebomb.

1. **Find a specific question** in a watering hole where your audience hangs out — forums, mailing list, even Twitter. Don’t overthink this step. It doesn’t have to be a “huge”, “important," or even an unanswered question, but you do want your ebomb to be something that the reader can do.
2. Address an answer specifically to that person.
3. Ship it, by posting it on your blog.
4. Share the link with them.

It’s really that simple to get started. Sure, you can get fancier… and yes, Ebombs can & should be written with an eye towards a bigger goal… but you don’t need to start that way.

Start with just one blog post. One simple question, one simple answer.

## Customer Research with No Customers

[https://www.designacademy.io/customer-research-with-no-customers/]()

1. First, know who your target customer is
2. Finding where your prospects hang out online
3. Don’t just use one source. Variety is always better.

 *“For example, if books on visual design didn’t exist, maybe I’d be looking for books about user experience design or CSS. I’d be looking for books that web developers would read that are somewhat related to the problem I’m trying to help them solve.”*

## The easiest (and most effective) way to write copy for your landing page - Part 1

[https://www.designacademy.io/writing-copy-part-1/][4]
You are not your customer: curate, don’t create.

1. Survey people in your audience
2. Interview people in your audience
3. Comb through past sales calls, emails, and reviews

## 5 Rules for Content Marketing that Sells

[https://stackingthebricks.com/5-rules-content-that-sells/][5]

### There are really only five ways to grow a business

1. Advertising
2. Paid referrals / affiliates
3. Direct sales
4. SEO / marketplace placement
5. Content marketing

(All five ways can lead to word of mouth and “earned” media — and paying for PR is analogous to paying for ads — so these models don’t qualify as a separate mechanism in my universe.)
I’m not a fan of options 1 through 3, personally. They’re expensive and shape your entire business in a way that I am mostly not interested in.

### Content marketing doesn’t work as executed by most people

You can’t just slap some random content willy-nilly on your blog and expect results.

Which… is what most people do. Content marketing is powerful because you create something once and it builds trust, reputation, and traffic.

You have to get strategic.

#### LUCKILY, THERE IS A WAY THAT WORKS

For staying power and impact, you want to create content that is…

- thematic
- specific enough to make your audience cry “it me!!”
- broad enough to be applicable to a large segment of your audience *-of clear*value, and preferably something they can apply soon
- enduring enough to be reusable for at least 12-24 months

## Don’t Fave This Post (Unless you’re actually going to Start)

[https://stackingthebricks.com/dont-fave-this-post/][6]

3. Learn How to Start — and Keep Going

Tiny wins, made regularly
Tiny wins don’t look like much at first:
• shipping a single blog post
• …and another, and another
• adding 5 subscribers to your newsletter
• writing one page
• fixing one bug
• recording one short video
• making your very first sale
• receiving a single happy email from a reader or customer

4. Here’s how to Start Small:
1. Grab yourself a free WordPress.com blog, if you don’t have a blog already.
2. Look at the audiences you belong to: Are you a Ruby developer? an advertising copywriter? A UX tester? A designer who works for startups?
3. Identify several questions people in your audience often have — these can be technical, philosophical, financial, specific, general, whatever.
4. Write a blog post answering one of them.
5. Tweet about it. Email it to your friends (but don’t spam them).
6. Do it again next week.

## How to Write Prolifically

[https://www.animalz.co/blog/how-to-write-prolifically/][7]

*“To keep both these fears at bay, I developed a strict “validated topics only” rule. That extra time during manager block that I mentioned? Researching and validating.*

*This was for finding research, brainstorming, combing thought ideas and topics, finding the ones with potential and doing enough initial legwork to know the piece would actually hold up.“*

#### Author’s Trello for managing content workflows

1. Ideas
2. Validating
3. Validated
4. Writing and editing
5. Ready for Wordpress
6. Scheduled in Wordpress
7. Published

#### Details

- Ideas: The first column—"Ideas"—was wide open. I’m a proponent of big backlogs and a “no bad ideas” approach. Every idea, even ones you think are bad or half-baked, go on there. A year from now that bad idea might weave together with two new ideas and turn into something great. Large backlogs are a secret weapon for a content program.
- Validating: The next column—"Validating"—was way more selective. These are topics where I felt like there was potential, and in a less-efficient system I might have just started writing right from here. The idea in "Validating" is to take topics from gut feel to a place where I’ve got some evidence the topic is sound and I’m confident enough to spend a day writing.
- Validated: From here, topics either move on to "Validated" or back to "Ideas." "Validated" became the column I could pull from at the beginning of each maker block. I could start my day knowing I had a strong topic that wouldn’t fall apart, I had research to work from

## Hubs vs Pillars

[https://www.animalz.co/blog/hubs-vs-pillars/][8]

### Hubs vs Spokes Purposes

*…“hubs, spokes, clusters, and pillars. Each alludes to an SEO strategy that calls for a lot of content to help rank for a competitive keyword.”…*

#### Hub Content

*“A hub’s purpose is to send visitors to the spoke pages, not to keep them on the hub page. The hub is a table of contents that links out towards many articles that cover subtopics. To maximise efficacy, hubs should link to all spokes. Each spoke should link other spokes and should link back to the hub.”*

#### Pillar Content

*“A pillar is a single, usually very long, piece of content that covers a topic in exhaustive depth. It is designed to attract a reader and keep that reader on the page.”*

# How to Start a Professional Blog: 10 Tips for New Bloggers

[https://andrewchen.co/how-to-start-a-professional-blog-10-tips-for-new-bloggers/][9]

## How to Start Blogging from Scratch

1. Carpet bomb a key area and stake out mindshare
2. Take time to find your voice
3. Stay consistent on your blog format and topic
4. Just show up (write approx 1. Per week)
5. Go deep on your topic of expertise
6. Meatspace and the blogosphere are tightly connected
7. Embrace the universal reader acquisition strategies for blogs
8. Come up with new topics with brainstorms, news headlines and notes-to-self
9. Don’t look at your analytics every day
10. Don’t overdo it

### On finding your voice

*”I ‌found that as I wrote more consistently, and learned from other bloggers, I began to change the tone and voice of my articles. While some of the key elements were always present – essays rather than links, certain topical themes, etc. – I added much better formatting within the blog posts, photos, linking to other blogs, etc.”*

### Staying Consistent

Blog format really matters, and it seems there’s two very different kind of successful blogs.

1. Curators
2. Original content creators. (Primary content source)

### Universal reader acquisition strategies for blogs

- SEO, specifically Google
- Blog aggregators (like Designer News, Hacker News, Design Newsletters, etc.)
- Social platforms (like twitter, product hunt, indie hackers, devto, reddit, etc.)
- Individual blog links

*“Similarly, whatever your expertise is, you might find vertical aggregators that drive a lot of traffic. For me, it’s Hacker News, Techmeme, and others. Identifying those key aggregators and submitting your articles is key.”*

## 10 Years of Professional Blogging — what I’ve learned

[https://andrewchen.co/professional-blogging/][10]

### Building your personal bat signal

*“I continue to recommend … as a way to send out the “bat signal” on their aspirations, ideas and interests”.*

*“It’s awesome, but insanely hard to get started. … the hard part is finding your voice, figuring out topics that are interesting for other folks to read, and building a long-term habit”*

### The lessons

- Titles are 80% of the work, but you write it as the very last thing. It has to be a compelling opinion or important lesson
- There’s always room for high-quality thoughts/opinions. Venn diagram of people w/ knowledge and those who can communicate is tiny
- Writing is the most scalable professional networking activity – stay home, don’t go to events/conferences, and just put ideas down
- Think of your writing on the same timescale as your career. Write on a multi-decade timeframe. This means, don’t just pub on Quora/Medium
- Focus on writing frequency over anything else. Schedule it. Don’t worry about building an immediate audience. Focus on the intrinsic.
- To develop the habit, put a calendar reminder each Sunday for 2 hours. Forced myself to stare at a blank text box and put something down
- Most of my writing comes from talking/reading deciding I strongly agree or disagree. These opinions become titles. Titles become essays.
- People are often obsessed with needing to write original ideas. Forget it. You’re a journalist with a day job in the tech industry
- An email subscriber is worth 100x twitter or LinkedIn followers or whatever other stuff is out there. An email = a real channel
- I started writing while working at a VC. They asked, “Why give away ideas? That’s your edge.” Ironic that VCs blog/tweet all day now ;)
- Publishing ideas, learnings, opinions, for years & years is a great way to give. And you’ll figure out how to capture value later

#### Titles

*"Titles are best when they can pass the “hidden share” test – imagine some text that’s so compelling that even if it’s not linked to anything, people will want to share it.”*

*"Just avoid vague titles like “Here are my thoughts on XYZ.” No one cares.”*

*"I often write a placeholder title, write the essay, and then at the very end, spend a good chunk of time iterating on titles until there’s a good one.”*

#### Room for more blogs

*"There’s always room though, when you think of the whitespace as Knowledge x Communication x Medium.”*

#### Developing a habit

*"Nevertheless, because initially no one will read your work, the key is just to get started. Your initial topics and format should be whatever you can do easily and maintain some sort of frequency.”*
