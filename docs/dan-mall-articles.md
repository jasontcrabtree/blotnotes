1. [Imitate](http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/#imitate)
2. [Remix](http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/#remix)
3. [Invent](http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/#invent)

“Think of it like learning to draw by tracing. In fact, it’s literally the same thing.”

“Once you can confidently imitate any style you come across, you can start to tweak the elements to feel more custom to the way you need to use it.”

"author Steven Johnson describes a concept he calls the adjacent possible

The adjacent possible is about taking two seemingly unconnected ideas and metaphorically placing them next to each other to see how they might work together.”

**Progressive enhancement:**

“Progressive enhancement focuses on the content. Note the difference: *I didn’t even mention browsers*.”

“Start with your content peanut, marked up in rich, semantic (X)HTML. Coat that content with a layer of rich, creamy CSS. Finally, add JavaScript as the hard candy shell to make a wonderfully tasty treat (and keep it from melting in your hands)."

- “That’s why I’ve often opted to show full comps as early as possible”
- “Wireframes and moodboards tend to be too abstract.”
- Create **visual** examples to show design directions
- DM: *[Style tiles are] a catalyst for discussions around the preferences and goals of the client.* <http://styletil.es/>
- Samantha Warren: “Style Tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web.”

<http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/visual-inventory/>

Visual Inventory: Having an example/prior art focused conversation to focus in on specific colours, typography and conceptual directions the client is interested in.

“I’ll still do multiple concepts now, but they’ll more likely be iterations and variations of each other that actually encourage “frankensteining” rather than being wildly different and independent.”

<https://alistapart.com/article/art-direction-and-design/>

“Art direction gives substance to design. Art direction adds humanity to design.”

“Art direction transcends custom blog posts. It is something different and extraordinary. Art direction elevates and enhances meaning.”

| Tool        | Art Direction                                                | Design                                                       |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Color       | Does this color scheme fit the brand? Is it appropriate for the situation? Bright colors may not fit a sad message. | Do these colors look good together? Are they [vibrating](http://webstandards.psu.edu/accessibility/tech/color/vibrate)? Is each color the best choice for the medium, e.g., Pantone swatch for print, web-safe online? |
| Typography  | What does this font connote? How do the letterforms themselves send the message without the actual words? Comic Sans might be too silly, but Helvetica might be too vanilla. | Does my assortment of type sizes create the right visual hierarchy? Does this font have enough weights to be used in this context? |
| Composition | How balanced should this composition be? Balanced compositions are pleasing but often passive. Unbalanced compositions are often uneasy and unsettling but visually more interesting. | Are my margins even? Is there a natural rhythm in the visuals that will guide a person’s eye through the piece? |
| Concept     | How well do the visuals support and convey the mood of the brand? What is the message or story the design conveys? | How well do the visuals align with the brand guidelines for logo spacing, appropriate typography, and color palette? |
| Overall     | Does it feel good?                                           | Does it look good?                                           |

“This is where art direction thrives: deciding which moments to scream from the mountaintops and which moments to keep as secrets.”

<http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/finding-clients/>

“Great clients aren’t strewn about across the surface for you to scoop up at your leisure. Like valuable jewels, great clients aren’t found; they’re earned.”

*Full section quote:*

Let’s say your favorite kind of work is identity design for flower shops.

1. Make a list of 20 flower shops in your area.
2. Do some research to find out how much revenue they generate in a month—either by using publicly available data or even just asking—and put together an identity package that you price at a fraction of that revenue that will still make you a good living.
3. Call each one and ask for 30 minutes of their time.
4. Pitch the heck out of them. Make an undeniable case for how your work for them will reap ten times the amount they’d be spending on you.

Soon enough, you’ll have a stellar portfolio of flower shop identity packages, and you’ll become the flower shop identity magnet you were hoping to be all along.

- “Make your own (fake) work [just make sure you’re clear about stating that you created the brief yourself).]”
- “Unsolicited redesigns ... should a) acknowledge constraints—as [I mention](http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/how-to-get-the-work-you-want/#comment-1186123318) in the comment thread—and b) solve a problem. ”
- "First assignments … reproduce existing sites. … The next part … change a handful of things … to see what impact that has on a design.”
- “If you’re in design or just starting out teaching yourself, there’s a pretty high chance that you’ve got some free time. Use that time to fill your portfolio with projects you’d love to be hired to do.”
- Prompt to create a brief: Finish this sentence. “I love [brand name] because [reason for liking them]. What should I make?”
- “Contribute to the conversations you want to be part of. … on twitter, blogs, slacks, discords, communities”
- "Google “[brand name] agency of record.”“

<http://danmall.me/articles/onlyness/>

Creating an ‘only-XYZ’ statement.

Here’s an example. Harley-Davidson is:

| What  | The only motorcycle manufacturer          |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| How   | that makes big, loud motorcycles          |
| Who   | for macho guys (and macho wannabes)       |
| Where | mostly in the United States               |
| Why   | who want to join a gang of cowboys        |
| When  | in an era of decreasing personal freedom. |

This is the only [type of experience] that [USP/service or product] for [audience] in [location or market] who want to [customers emotional motivation] during a time of [increasing or decreasing cultural trend].

<http://danmall.me/articles/how-to-scope-work/>

Simply put, I like to define scope as:

1. A description of all the work that needs to get done, and

2. The time needed to do said work.

“By breaking it down into digestible chunks, it’s much more manageable!”

You can continue to break down each task further if it’s useful to do so, but, even at this level, you can realistically assess the work. Can you write a section of HTML in 30 minutes? If yes, great! You’re on schedule and will make your timeline. If not, what can you adjust or reorder to make it work?

Scoping is about appropriately setting expectations for yourself, your team, and your clients and managers. It’s a rare skill that separates the amateurs from the professionals. Which one are you?

<http://danmall.me/articles/break-even-points-value-pricing/>

**Key question to ask for value based pricing:**

- At what point does this project pay for itself?

  *Great answers include:*

  - After 100 additional students enrol.
  - When we get an average of 5 more leads a month.
  - When we add 1,000 more people to or mailing list.
  - When people prefer us over our top competitor.

Answers I’ve heard that make me think they’re not ready for a project (at least not with [SuperFriendly](http://superfriend.ly/)):

- I don’t know.
- Why is that any of your business?
- There’s no way we can quantify that.

“Smart clients know what change they’re looking for, even if they don’t know how to achieve it. (That’s why they’re hiring help.) Sometimes I’ll try to help them *articulate* the value, but I don’t try to *define* it for them.”

“A client that knows what they want knows where the project pays for itself, where it breaks even. And that’s the first price ceiling.”

“But what if you’re confident than you could get them 2,000 signups? Then they may accept a $10,000 price because you’re delivering twice the results they’re expecting. Here’s the kicker: that’s still a break-even price, even though it’s double their stated budget.”

“**You can confidently price over any stated budget if you can demonstrate that you will deliver more value than their break-even metric.**”

“When you value price, every price you give a client should be at least a break-even price. Better yet, every price you give a client should be a “they got a deal” price.”

<http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/pricing/>

**Step 1: Imitate**

Charge hourly (everyone does for their first project). Pick a number at random — between $25 - 50 an hour.

(Professional/experienced designers/developers charge $70 - 120 an hour)

Do your first project, say, design and build a 1-page brochure website for $700 over a week?

**Step 2: Question**

Then ask yourself, was the time commitment worth the outcome? If yes, then it’s a good rate for now. If no, and your gut says it wasn’t worth it — charge more!

If your gut says no, then $35/hour is too low. So, what’s your weekend worth to you?

*“1,000? $1,500? 2,000? Let’s say you’d give up your weekend for 1,500, but not a penny less. That means your rate should be 75/hour (​1500 ÷ 20 hours), because you’d rather go see a movie for anything less.”*

*“If that feels too nebulous, here’s a tip: Instead of picking a dollar amount, think of something you’d trade. I call it object value pricing. If your friend’s mom wanted you to design and build a one-page website, would you do it for a fast food dinner? What about a new 42" TV? A new camera? That Ikea sofa you’ve been meaning to get?”*

Do this a couple of times, and you’ll start to get a sense of a few things:

- You’ll see how well you scope
- You’ll start to realise what’s important to you
- You’ll develop your own gut feeling about these things.

**Step 3: Experiment**

Once you start to develop this gut-level Spidey-sense about pricing, you can play around with things.

Here are some things you could experiment with:

- Double your rate for your next customer.
- If you currently bill hourly, try a fixed price next time. If you currently charge fixed prices, try hourly. See which one you like better, and why.
- See how much extra a customer will pay for things like early delivery, exclusivity, a la carte features, and more.

Here, Josh provides four steps to effective design pricing:

1. **Determine your hourly wage:**
   (Expenses + Salary) Ã· Hours Worked Per Year = Hourly Wage
2. **Develop base prices:**
   (Hourly Wage x Estimated Time To Complete) x Complexity Level = Base Price
3. **Develop prices for additional requirements:**
   Assign a complexity level system and put them into the formula above.
4. **Develop prices for outsourced work:**
   (Quote From Contractor x 1.10) = Price

But always remember… there is no exact formula.

<https://alistapart.com/article/pricing-strategy-for-creatives/>

**Pricing Strategy for Creatives**

1. Price by the service, not the hour
   - Hourly pricing is misaligned with your client
   - Hourly pricing ignores the value of the outcome for your client
   - Hourly billing prevents creative billing incentives, etc. performance based bonus payments
2. Slow down your sales process (and choose clients more thoughtfully)
3. Add extra value to your client’s experience with your service
4. Set up a client intake process evaluating what they need and value and how you can help
5. Change how you think about pricing to charge what you’re worth

<https://justcreative.com/2008/09/26/how-to-write-an-effective-design-brief/>

**How to Write an Effective Design Brief** (written from the perspective of the customer)

Answer these questions in order, in detail. Remember, have fun and provide as much detail as possible!

**What does your business do?**

*Tip: Never assume that the designer will know anything about your company. Be clear and  concise  and avoid jargon when replying.*

- What does your company / organisation do?
- What is your company’s history?

**What are the goals?  Why?**

- What is the overall goal of the new design project?
- What are you trying to communicate and why?
- Are you trying to sell more products or get awareness of your product / service?
- How do you differ from your competitors?
- Do you want to completely reinvent yourself or are you simply updating your promotional material?

*Tip:  You should also provide old promotional material to assist the designer.*

**Who is the target market?**

- What are your target market’s demographics & psychographics? ie. the age, gender, income, tastes, views, attitudes, employment, geography, lifestyle of those you want to reach.

*Tip: If you have multiple audiences, rank them in terms of importance.*

**What copy (text) and pictures are needed?**

*Tip: The copy and pictures used in a design are as crucial as the design itself and you should clearly state who is going to be providing the copy and pictures if needed.  You may need to look into getting a professional copywriter / photographer – ask your designer for some recommendations.*

- What copy needs to be included in the design? Who is providing the copy?
- What pictures / photographs / diagrams etc need to be used? Who is providing these?

**What are the specifications?**

- What size is the design going to be?
- Where is it going to be printed / used? The web, business cards, stationery, on your car?
- What other information should the designer know in regards to specifications?

**Have you got a benchmark in mind?**

- You should provide the designer with some examples of what you consider to be effective or relevant design even if it is from your main competitors. This will set a benchmark for your designer.
- Provide the designer with things not to do, and styles that you do not like or wish to see in your design. This will give the designer an idea of what to avoid and will avoid disappointment on your behalf.

**What Is Your Budget?**

- Providing a budget prevents designers wasting valuable time and  resources when trying to maximise your budget.
- Providing the budget upfront also allows designers to know if the project is going to be worthwhile to complete. Make sure you are worth their time.

**What is the time scale / deadline?**

- Give the designer a detailed schedule of the project and set a realistic deadline for the completion of the work. You should take into account the various stages of the design project such as consultation, concept development, production and delivery.

*Tip: Rushing design jobs helps no one and mistakes can be made if a complex job is pushed through without time to review, however, there are times when a rush job is needed, and in these cases you should be honest and upfront about it.*

**Tips For The Designer**

As a designer it is important to have a template such as this one to give to clients as clients will not always come to you with a design brief – feel free to use this one as you please. By having a template ready, it shows them your professionalism and ultimately saves them (and you) a lot of time and money.

**Do you have any more tips of what should be in a design brief? Leave them in the comments below.**

Offering clients a tiered pricing options, e.g. Option A, Option A + B, Option A + B + C each at different levels of price.

![img](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326143418im_/http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-05-at-5.34.21-PM2-579x452.png)

**Tiered Model for Value-Based Pricing**

“A tiered model lays out multiple options at different price points and empowers purchasers to make better, more informed decisions that feel less arbitrary.”

“Laying out options gives clients a clear way to compare, contrast and ultimately be more intentional about who they decide to award their business too and why.”

<https://superfriendlydesign.systems/articles/starting-a-design-system/>

**Starting a Design System**

When SuperFriendly works with clients to create design systems, they first audit existing design properties. Common elements exist:

- Navigation
- Buttons
- Headings
- Lists
- Paragraphs
- Forms
- Tables

“A good design system should be [a collection of your organisation’s best institutional knowledge](https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html#solvedproblemsandsettledscience).”

“If you don’t use buttons a lot in those products, don’t include them!”

**Question: How do I start a design system?**

Pick 3 components used often throughout your products. Pick the best versions of each of these.

Put those components somewhere.

Make sure you include:

- Front-end code needed to implement the component (not just a design tool!)
- Guidelines on how (and how not) to use the component
- A URL to make it shareable

<https://superfriendlydesign.systems/articles/typography-in-design-systems/>

**Typography in Design Systems**

“A typographic system that optimises for guessability.”

Typography in design systems is hard, messy, and easy to break the system. SM - M - L - XL systems quickly break down, likewise semantic HTML naming or type scale systems — especially as conflicts arise between presentation (styling) and markup (HTML). A font system of 16px > 20px breaks at the introduction of 14px, if needed.

DM: Seeing where (T-Shirt, Semantic, Named) systems break-down has taught me a few things:

1. Linear systems work well when we can accurately predict how they’ll scale, and we humans suck at predicting how others will use the systems we create.
2. Abstracting styles are difficult but worthwhile for true reusability.
3. In a system designed to be used frequently, intuitiveness may be over-valued.

Solution: use a system based on guessability! Early ideas of; Airplane sizes, Brady Bunch characters, Simpson characters.

Demanding common knowledge — these systems fail long-term.

**Common Knowledge**

To solve this problem, DM set himself a challenge of create 7 universal type sizes based on common knowledge. Keeping it simple — he named those sizes

`text-preset-1 (largest) through text-preset-7 (smallest)`

When a new size is needed, add it to the end.

Using BEM, these can be modified with

`text-preset-1--bold`

Using CSS variables, this creates a highly flexible system that is extremely guessable.

This has been extremely useful — tested over 45 pilots (used in the context of TV pilots, a first taste-test of design systems).
