## 01. How to Design an Ecommerce Store

**Design Inspiration**

- Create a Moodboard: Collage of ideas, images, colours and fonts that will serve as inspiration
- Seek inspiration from sites like Commerce Cream — showing the best of Shopify <https://commercecream.com/>
- Shopify theme provides 100+ high quality themes to get you started quickly. Themes are filtered by categories, layouts, products types, number of products, price, and a range of other features, letting you quickly choose the theme you need <https://themes.shopify.com/themes>
- Themes sometimes focus specifically on mobile-first or desktop-first, an important distinction to make
- Stephan will focus on a theme that features an instagram feed

**3 Step Framework to Designing your Store**

- Remember — everyone started somewhere. Use the wayback machine to see older versions of popular stores, often they have come along way!

**3 Step Framework**

1. Empathy:
   - Talk to your (potential) customer! Lots!
   - Why is the customer coming to your website?
   - How are they feeling?
   - Where are they coming from?
2. Define the problem
   - Define the specific customer problem you are solving
   - Gather data to validate the problem
   - Design your store to solve that problem
   - Understand the difference between your problem (I want to sell something) and the *customers real problem.*
3. Iterate
   - Focus iteration on user problems and user research
   - Seek feedback from fellow Shopify devs to understand what to improve
   - Get an audit from an ecommerce agency or a specific CRO/SEO shop

**Pillars of Modern Ecommerce Design**

1. **Trust (earn)**
   - Contact information
   - Return policies
   - Display certifications/marks of authenticity
2. **Visual Appeal**
   - Product photography: The Gold Standard is a white background studio image, plus lifestyle or in-use photos
   - Colours: Recommended to use two main colours, a primary and second. Stephen uses Dribble to find colour palettes
   - Typography: Use typography to build brand identity and the specific emotion of your store. Define hierarchy. Stick to two fonts.
3. **Form**
   - Consider desktop vs. Mobile, cart experience, slide-out drawers, etc
4. **Navigation**
   - Limit navigation to focus on key pages
   - Be as clear and descriptive as possible
   - Recommended Nav Labels
     - Shop ‘Product Name’
     - Best Sellers
     - About Us
     - Contact
   - Recommended Footer Labels
     - Shop “Product Name”
     - Return Policy
     - Terms of Service
     - Contact Info
